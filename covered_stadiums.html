<h1 class = "center">Covered Stadiums</h1>
<p>The following is a list of covered sports stadiums, ordered by capacity; that is the maximum number of spectators the stadium can accommodate for a sports event. This is intended to include only stadiums that are used for sports traditionally held outdoors. It is split into two sublists:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stadiums designed for field sports, such as baseball and any of a wide variety of football codes.</li>
    <li>Tennis stadiums (a traditional outdoor sport, but with a much smaller playing area)</li>
</ul>
Only domed and retractable roof stadiums are included, i.e. stadiums that cover both spectators and playing field. The stadiums are divided into current stadiums, closed stadiums, and future stadiums (those currently under-construction and those planned for construction).

Indoor arenas should not be included on this list as there is a separate list for them.

<p>AT&T Stadium, formerly Cowboys Stadium, is a city-owned 80,000-seat capacity stadium with a retractable roof in Arlington, Texas, United States. It serves as the home of the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). It replaced the partially covered Texas Stadium, which opened in 1971 and served as the Cowboys' home through the 2008 season. It was completed on May 27, 2009. The facility can also be used for a variety of other activities outside of its main purpose (professional football), such as concerts, basketball games, college and high school football contests, soccer matches, and motocross and Spartan races.</p>

<p>The stadium is sometimes referred to as "Jerry World" after Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who originally envisioned it as a large entertainment mecca.The stadium seats 80,000,making it the fifth largest stadium in the NFL by seating capacity. The maximum capacity of the stadium with standing room is 105,000. The record attendance for an NFL game was set in 2009 with a crowd of 105,121. The Party Pass (open areas) sections are behind seats in each end zone and on a series of six elevated platforms connected by stairways. It also has the world's 24th largest high definition video screen, which hangs from 20-yard line to 20-yard line.</p>

<p>The Millennium Stadium (Welsh: Stadiwm y Mileniwm), currently known for sponsorship purposes as the Principality Stadium (Welsh: Stadiwm Principality), is the national stadium of Wales, located in Cardiff. It is the home of the Wales national rugby union team and has also staged games of the Wales national football team. Initially built to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup, it has gone on to host many other large-scale events, such as the Tsunami Relief concert, the Super Special Stage of Wales Rally Great Britain, the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain and various music concerts. It also hosted six FA Cup finals and several other high-profile football fixtures whilst Wembley Stadium was being redeveloped.</p>

<p>The stadium is owned by Millennium Stadium plc, a subsidiary company of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The stadium was designed by a team led by architects Bligh Lobb Sports Architecture. WS Atkins were the structural engineers, and the building contractor was Laing. The total construction cost of the stadium was £121 million, of which the Millennium Commission funded £46 million.</p>

<p>The Millennium Stadium opened in June 1999 and its first major event was an international rugby union match on 26 June 1999, when Wales beat South Africa in a test match by 29–19 before a crowd of 29,000. With a total seating capacity of 74,500, it is the third-largest stadium in the Six Nations Championship behind the Stade de France and Twickenham. It is also the second-largest stadium in the world with a fully retractable roof and was the second stadium in Europe to have this feature. Listed as a category four stadium by UEFA, the stadium was chosen as the venue for the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final. On 8 September 2015, the Welsh Rugby Union announced a 10-year sponsorship deal with the Principality Building Society that saw the stadium renamed as the "Principality Stadium" from 22 January 2016.</p>

<img class = "TextWrap" src="covered_stadiums/Georgia_Dome.jpg"  alt="Georgia_Dome">
<p>The Georgia Dome is a domed stadium located in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, between downtown to the east and Vine City to the west. It is owned and operated by the State of Georgia as part of the Georgia World Congress Center Authority. It was primarily the home stadium for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL) and the Georgia State Panthers football team from Georgia State University. Also, it has hosted the Peach Bowl since 1992 and the SEC Championship Game since 1994. In addition, the Georgia Dome has also hosted several soccer matches since 2009 that have drawn over 50,000 fans.</p>

<p>The Dome is accessible by rail via MARTA's Blue and Green lines, which service the nearby Dome/GWCC/Philips Arena/CNN Center and Vine City stations.</p>

<p>The Georgia Dome was the largest covered stadium in the world by capacity when it opened in 1992, but it has since been surpassed by AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas and by Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales.</p>
<p>In 1992, the Georgia Dome was completed at a cost of $214 million (US), which came from the Georgia General Assembly, making it one of the largest state-funded construction projects in Georgia history. It seats 74,228 for football, and can hold approximately: 80,000 for concerts, 71,000 for basketball when the dome is fully open and 40,000 for basketball and gymnastics when the dome is sectioned off (one half closed off by a large curtain). For most Georgia State football games, the dome is configured with 28,155 seats, with tickets for only the bulk of the lower level and the club-level seats on sale. The record for overall attendance at the Georgia Dome is 80,892 for the 2008 SEC Championship Game in football.</p>

<p>The Mercedes-Benz Superdome, often referred to simply as the Superdome, is a domed sports and exhibition venue located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. It primarily serves as the home venue for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL), and is also the home stadium for the Sugar Bowl and New Orleans Bowl in college football. Plans were drawn up in 1967 by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis and the building opened as the Louisiana Superdome in 1975. Its steel frame covers a 13-acre (5.3 ha) expanse and the 273-foot (83 m) dome is made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of 680 feet (210 m), making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world.It is adjacent to the Smoothie King Center.</p>

<p>Because of the building's size and location in one of the major tourist destinations of the United States, the Superdome routinely hosts major sporting events, including the Super Bowl, College Football Championship Game, and the Final Four in college basketball. The stadium was also the long-time home of the Tulane Green Wave football team of Tulane University until 2013 and was the home venue of the New Orleans Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1975 until 1979.</p>

<p>The Superdome gained international attention of a different type in 2005 when it housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina. The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was closed for many months afterward. It was eventually decided the building would be fully refurbished and reopened in time for the Saints' 2006 home opener on September 25.</p>

<p>NRG Stadium, formerly Reliant Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium, in Houston, Texas, United States. NRG Stadium has a seating capacity of 71,795, a total area of 1,900,000 square feet (180,000 m2) with a 97,000 sq ft (9,000 m2) playing surface.</p>

<p>The stadium is the home of the National Football League's Houston Texans, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, the Texas Bowl, host to many international soccer matches for the USA National Soccer Team, and other events. The stadium served as the host facility for Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1, 2004 and WrestleMania XXV on April 5, 2009.</p>
<p>The stadium was designed by the architectural firms of Hermes Reed Architects and Lockwood, Andrews and Newnam who were teamed to create the Houston Stadium Consultants (HSC). The architects of Populous (then HOK Sport) and the HSC worked together with engineers from Walter P Moore and Uni-Systems to design the stadium utilizing the principles of kinetic architecture.The facility offers a sense of transparency, with its fabric roof and expansive areas of glazing. At night, the building appears to glow from within. The extensive use of glass provides an open-air feel to the concourses, which are open to the field of play. NRG Stadium has over 7,000 club seats, 186 luxury suites, and multiple lounges and bars. The stadium can be configured to utilize a 125,000-square-foot (11,600 m2) space for meetings, specialty functions, exhibits, and concerts.</p>

<p>NRG Stadium is part of a collection of venues (including the Astrodome), which are collectively called NRG Park. The entire complex is named for NRG Energy under a 32-year, US$300 million naming rights deal in 2000.</p>

<p>The stadium was constructed at the cost of $352 million. NRG Stadium is the first facility in the NFL to have a retractable roof.</p>

<p>NRG Stadium will host Super Bowl LI in 2017. It also hosted all 10 of the University Interscholastic League's Texas high school football championship games at the conclusion of the 2015 season.</p>

	<p>U.S. Bank Stadium is a fixed-roof stadium located in the Downtown East section of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, on the former site of Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. U.S. Bank Stadium serves as the home of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL) and the Minnesota Golden Gophers Baseball Team (NCAA). The Vikings played at the Metrodome from 1982 until its closure in 2013 and before that at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota from 1961 to 1981. During the 2014 and 2015 seasons, the Vikings played at TCF Bank Stadium on the campus of the University of Minnesota while the new stadium was being built. On June 17, 2016, U.S. Bank Stadium was deemed substantially complete by contractor Mortenson Construction. The stadium was substantially completed six weeks before the ribbon-cutting ceremony and official grand opening, which was held on July 22, 2016. Authority to use and occupy the stadium was handed over to the Vikings and the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority. The Vikings played the first regular-season game at U.S. Bank Stadium on September 18, 2016, against the Green Bay Packers on NBC Sunday Night Football.</p>

<p>It is the first fixed-roof stadium built in the NFL since Ford Field, home of the Detroit Lions, opened in 2002. As of March 2015, the overall budget was estimated to be $1.061 billion, of which $348 million is coming from the state of Minnesota, $150 million from the city of Minneapolis, and $551 million from the team and private contributions. U.S. Bank Stadium is scheduled to host Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018, the 2019 NCAA Final Four, and the ESPN X Games in 2017 and 2018. On June 15, 2015, the Vikings announced that U.S. Bank had acquired the naming rights to the stadium. The naming deal is worth $220 million over 25 years.</p>

<p>Olympic Stadium (French: Stade olympique) is a multi-purpose stadium in Canada, located at Olympic Park in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district of Montreal. Built in the mid-1970s as the main venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics, it is nicknamed "The Big O", a reference to both its name and to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium's roof. It is also called "The Big Owe" to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole.</p>

<p>The stadium is the largest by seating capacity in Canada. After the Olympics, artificial turf was installed and it became the home of Montreal's professional baseball and football teams. The Montreal Alouettes of the CFL returned to their previous home of Molson Stadium in 1998 for regular season games, but continued to use Olympic Stadium for playoff and Grey Cup games until 2014 when they returned to Molson Stadium for all of their games. Following the 2004 baseball season, the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C. to become the Washington Nationals. The stadium currently serves as a multipurpose facility for special events (e.g. concerts, trade shows) with a permanent seating capacity of 56,040. The capacity is expandable with temporary seating. The Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer (MLS) use the venue on occasion, when larger capacity is needed or when the weather restricts outdoor play at nearby Saputo Stadium in the spring months.</p>

<p>The stadium has not had a main tenant since the Expos left in 2004. Despite decades of use, the stadium's history of numerous structural and financial problems has largely branded it a white elephant.</p>
<p>Incorporated into the north base of the stadium is the Montreal Tower, the world's tallest inclined tower at 175 metres (574 ft). The stadium and Olympic Park grounds border Maisonneuve Park, which includes the Montreal Botanical Garden, adjacent to the west across Rue Sherbrooke (Route 138).</p>

<p>The Dome at America's Center or The Dome, formerly known as the Edward Jones Dome, is a multi-purpose stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. It primarily served as the home of the St. Louis Rams until 2015 when the Rams relocated back to Los Angeles in 2016. The stadium, previously known as the Trans World Dome from 1995 to 2001, was constructed largely to lure an NFL team back to St. Louis and to serve as a convention center.</p>

<p>The Dome provides multiple stadium configurations that can seat up to 70,000 people. Seating levels include a private luxury suite level with 120 suites, a private club seat and luxury suite level with 6,400 club seats, a concourse level (lower bowl) and a terrace level (upper bowl). The Dome opened in 1995.</p>

<p>The Dome is part of the America's Center convention center. The convention portion has a much bigger footprint and adjoins to the west of the Dome, Cole Street to the north, Broadway to the east and Convention Plaza to the south. It is accessible off Interstate 70 eastbound at the Convention Center/Broadway/Busch Stadium exit, I-70 westbound from Illinois at the Martin Luther King Jr./Veterans Memorial Bridge, and Interstate 55 southbound at the Gateway Arch/Busch Stadium exit. The stadium is also serviced by the Convention Center MetroLink rail station.</p>
<p>During its planning and construction, the Dome was known as The Dome at America's Center. Trans World Airlines, a St. Louis-based air carrier, purchased naming rights in 1995 and held them until 2001, when TWA was acquired by American Airlines (American already has its name on two NBA/NHL venues in Dallas and Miami). During this time, the Dome was known as the Trans World Dome.</p>

<p>The facility then briefly reverted to the Dome at America's Center until the naming rights were acquired on January 25, 2002 by Edward Jones Investments, a financial services firm based St. Louis.</p>

<p>The Alamodome is a domed 65,000-seat, multi-purpose facility used as a football, basketball, baseball stadium and convention center. It is located on the southeastern fringe of Downtown San Antonio, Texas, USA. The facility opened on May 15, 1993, having been constructed at a cost of US$186 million.</p>

<p>The multi-purpose facility was intended to increase the city's convention traffic and attract a professional football franchise. It also placated the San Antonio Spurs' demands for a larger arena. The Spurs played in the Alamodome for a decade, then became disenchanted with the facility and convinced Bexar County to construct a new arena for them, now called the AT&T Center. The Alamodome's biggest regular tenant is currently the UTSA Roadrunners.</p>
<p>The facility is a rectilinear 5-level stadium which can seat up to 65,000 spectators for a typical football game and is expandable to hold 72,000 spectators, allowing the possibility of hosting a Super Bowl.</p>

<p>When it was designed from the ground up to easily convert into a basketball or hockey arena. Converting the stadium for basketball and hockey takes 12–18 hours to set up retractable seating and installing the playing surface. In this configuration, typically only the two lower levels at one or both ends are used. The arena configuration seats 20,662 spectators, but is expandable to 39,500 when the upper level is opened.</p>
<p>The Alamodome opened with 38 luxury suites and 6,000 club level seats. The original design specifications called for 66 luxury suites. However, since the Spurs were the only full-time tenant at the time, only 38 luxury suites in the north end of the facility were built. The footprints for the 28 unbuilt luxury suites were open floor space just behind the club level seats that surround the south end of the facility. In 2006, the Alamodome underwent an expansion to accommodate 14 new luxury suites. The Sports Club and the Top of the Dome restaurant also received renovations in 2004.<p>

<p>Ford Field is a multi-purpose indoor stadium located in Downtown Detroit, Michigan, United States, owned by the Detroit/Wayne County Stadium Authority. It is primarily used for American football as the home field of the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) as well as the annual Quick Lane Bowl college football bowl game. The regular seating capacity is approximately 65,000, though it is expandable up to 70,000 for football and 80,000 for basketball. The naming rights were purchased by the Ford Motor Company at $40 million over 20 years; the Ford family holds a controlling interest in the company, and a member of the Ford family has controlled the Lions franchise since 1963.</p>
Ford Field was originally planned to be an outdoor stadium, simultaneously with Comerica Park, which opened in April 2000, as part of a public project to replace Tiger Stadium and the Pontiac Silverdome. Ford Field was constructed after Comerica Park, opening in 2002. It cost an estimated $430 million to build, financed largely through private money, public money, and the sale of the naming rights.

<p>The stadium's design incorporates a six-story former Hudson's warehouse, which was constructed in the 1920s. Hammes Company, a real estate development company in Middleton, Wisconsin, developed the new stadium, as well as the warehouse.</p>

<p>The presence of the warehouse allows for a seating arrangement that was unique among professional American football stadiums at the time of Ford Field's opening. The majority of suites at Ford Field are located in the Hudson Warehouse along the stadium's southern sideline, as are the lounges that serve the premium club seats on that side of the field. The bulk of the grandstand seats are located along the northern sideline and both end-lines, with gaps in the stadium's upper half at the southwest and southeast corners. The upper deck on the stadium's northern sideline also contains one level of suites and a smaller section of club seating. A similar design was implemented at the renovated Soldier Field, albeit with the use of a new structure (as opposed to an existing building) to house four levels of suites.</p>
